What is it?

LuaDoc is a Documentation Generator for Lua source code.  Like  JavaDoc
it parses the declarations and  documentation  comments  in  a  set  of
source files and produces a set of HTML pages describing the  commented
declarations and functions.

Distribution:

This distribution includes a set of  Lua  files  and  this  readme.  It
requires Lua 4.0.

analyze.lua		-- source code analyzer engine
sub.lua			-- rules for identifying source code parts
compose.lua		-- output composer engine
cmp.lua			-- rules for generating output files
luadoc.lua		-- main program

Installation:

To install LuaDoc, edit luadoc.lua to point to  your  Lua  installation
and set LUADOC_HOME variable to point to a directory where LuaDoc files
will reside.  Then, you may copy all files there.

On Unix boxes, the file luadoc.lua could be used as a script; it's  the
same as:

lua -f luadoc.lua [options|files]

This is the main script: it will load the other files and  process  the
options.  Try "luadoc.lua --help": this will  show  you  all  available
options.

How does it work?

LuaDoc works in two phases: analysis and synthesis.  On the first  one,
all input files are analyzed and an intermediate structure is made with
this information.  The second phase is responsible for  cross-reference
and the composition of the output.  Each phase has an engine  file  and
one or more description files, that describe the source format and  the
output format.  This distribution only have a description of Lua source
files and another for HTML output files.

Some technical documentation can  be  built  running  LuaDoc  over  its
files.
